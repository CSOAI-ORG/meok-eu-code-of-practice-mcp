## HEADLINE OPTIONS (pick one)

**A — The FEAST frame (lead with the prediction):**
> **MEOK AI Labs Ships First Open-Source EU Code-of-Practice-Ready AI Compliance Suite — 48 Days Before the Article 50 Cliff**
>
> Three new MCP servers give developers Ed25519-signed, offline-verifiable compliance for the EU AI Act's 2 August transparency obligations, the Digital Omnibus Art 5(1)(f) gambling prohibition, and the Annex III high-risk classification engine — all MIT-licensed, all free.

**B — The 1-number frame (lead with TAM):**
> **The EU's $50B AI Compliance Market Just Got Its First Open-Source Stack**
>
> MEOK AI Labs ships three production-grade MCP servers covering the EU Code of Practice on AI content marking (finalising this month), the Digital Omnibus Art 5(1)(f) psychological-vulnerability prohibition, and Annex III high-risk classification. All open-source, all signed.

**C — The pattern frame (lead with the East-First thesis):**
> **What China Regulated in 2023, the EU Regulates in 2026 — and There's Now an Open-Source Compliance Stack for It**
>
> MEOK AI Labs' three new MCP servers implement the EU AI Act's 2 August 2026 transparency cliff, the 12 May 2026 Digital Omnibus Art 5(1)(f) gambling prohibition, and the 2 December 2027 Annex III high-risk deadline — with offline-verifiable Ed25519 attestations.

**Recommendation:** A. It's the most concrete (date-specific), the most specific (named the cliff), and the most differentiator-framed (offline-verifiable signed compliance, not just "another tool").

## BODY (350 words, AP-style, no marketing fluff)

**LONDON, UK — 15 June 2026** — MEOK AI Labs (CSOAI Ltd) today released three new open-source Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers that give AI developers cryptographically-signed, offline-verifiable compliance with the EU AI Act's most pressing obligations: the 2 August 2026 Article 50 transparency cliff, the 12 May 2026 Digital Omnibus Article 5(1)(f) psychological-vulnerability prohibition, and the 2 December 2027 Annex III high-risk classification deadline.

The three servers are:

1. **`meok-eu-code-of-practice-mcp`** — implements the EU Code of Practice on AI content marking (finalising this month). Wraps C2PA Content Credentials (Layer 1) + watermarking (Layer 2) into a single signed manifest, with a public `verify_url` any auditor can check without contacting MEOK. **This is the first open-source tool that does both layers.**

2. **`meok-ai-psych-vuln-audit-mcp`** — implements the new Article 5(1)(f) prohibition on AI systems that exploit psychological vulnerabilities. Ships with a 12-pattern gambling-vertical rubric (loss-chasing detection bypass, vulnerable-player targeting, FOMO generation, near-miss obfuscation, and 8 others). Each pattern is keyed to the relevant EU AI Act article and the UK Gambling Commission's LCCP social responsibility codes. **The first vertical-specific compliance tool for the gambling industry.**

3. **`meok-annex-iii-impact-mcp`** — implements automated Annex III high-risk classification + Article 27 Fundamental Rights Impact Assessment (FRIA) generation + Annex IV technical documentation, all in deterministic offline keyword weighting (no LLM calls, fully reproducible). The classification takes <1 second and the same input always produces the same answer — a property that makes it legally defensible, since any auditor can re-run it and get the same result.

All three servers use Ed25519 signatures over canonical JSON. Every response includes a `signature` field (128 hex chars) and a `verify_url` that points to the public MEOK attestation API. Auditors can verify any output offline using the public key — no MEOK account, no MEOK API call, no MEOK involvement required.

"The pattern we see is that AI regulation follows a 3-to-5-year East-First cycle," said Nicholas Templeman, Founder of MEOK AI Labs. "China regulated content marking in 2023. The EU follows in 2026. The 2 August cliff is not a surprise — it's a predictable regulatory event. We built the compliance stack for it, and we're giving it away open-source, because the demand is going to be enormous and the only way to serve it is to make the tools free."

All three servers are MIT-licensed, installable via `pip install meok-eu-code-of-practice-mcp`, `meok-ai-psych-vuln-audit-mcp`, `meok-annex-iii-impact-mcp`, and registered in the official MCP Registry. The signing keys are managed by MEOK's keystone attestation API in production; demo keys are included for evaluation.

**Show HN post (draft, ~250 words):**
> Title: Show HN: MEOK AI Labs – Open-source MCP servers for the EU AI Act (48 days before Article 50)
>
> Three MIT-licensed MCP servers that give AI developers Ed25519-signed, offline-verifiable compliance with the EU AI Act:
>
> 1. EU Code of Practice on AI content marking (C2PA + watermark, single signed manifest)
> 2. Art 5(1)(f) gambling-vertical psychological-vulnerability audit (12 risk patterns)
> 3. Annex III high-risk classification + FRIA + Annex IV docs (deterministic, reproducible, <1s)
>
> All three are open-source, MIT, installable via pip, and registered in the official MCP Registry.
>
> Why these three now: the EU AI Act's Article 50 transparency obligations go into effect on 2 August 2026 for new generative AI systems. If you ship AI content into the EU market after that date without C2PA + watermarking, you're in violation. Most teams we talk to are unaware or underprepared.
>
> Why offline-verifiable: every response includes a 128-hex-char Ed25519 signature + a public verify URL. Auditors can check any output using the public key, with no MEOK account or API call. The keystone attestation API is at meok-attestation-api.vercel.app.
>
> Why the gambling vertical: the Digital Omnibus added Art 5(1)(f) in May 2026 — the prohibition on AI exploiting psychological vulnerabilities. Gambling is the obvious use case. We built the first vertical-specific rubric (12 risk patterns) instead of a generic one.
>
> Stack: Python, FastMCP, Pydantic v2, cryptography (Ed25519), canonical JSON. ~3,300 LOC across 21 files. Test count: 68 tests across the three servers, all <1s. Demo keys included; production keys are KMS-managed.
>
> Repo: github.com/csoai-org/<each>
> PyPI: pip install meok-eu-code-of-practice-mcp (etc.)
> Docs: meok.ai/eu-code-of-practice
>
> Founders note: I'm the solo founder of MEOK AI Labs, a UK company (CSOAI Ltd 16939677), building the open-source compliance layer for the sovereign AI era. We're 1.5 years into this, the substrate is live, the keystone is signed, and this is the first wave of "compliance-native from birth" products.

> Happy to answer questions about the architecture, the keystone, the East-First regulatory pattern, or why the 2 August cliff is the firing pin for the $50B AI compliance market.

## TIMING CONSIDERATIONS

- **Embargo until the EU Code of Practice finalises** (expected late June 2026). Don't publish before — the "first to support the standard" claim only works if the standard is announced.
- **The 2 August cliff is the firing pin.** All three press waves should hit between T-30 and T-7 days before.
- **Counter-programming risk:** OpenAI, Anthropic, or Microsoft could ship competing content-marketing tools in the same window. The defensive move: lead with the FEAST pattern (no one else has it) and the Ed25519-signed-and-offline-verifiable differentiator (no one else has that either).
- **Honest risk acknowledgment:** the FEAST report's "$50B market by 2028" claim is not falsifiable on current evidence. Don't use it in the press release. Use the 2 Aug cliff (which is real) and the East-First pattern (which is verifiable) instead.

## WHAT'S STILL NEEDED BEFORE THIS CAN SHIP

1. **The PRESS_LIST_1076.csv needs to exist on disk.** I searched and it's referenced in memory/skills but not in `~/clawd/`. The list itself needs to be built or imported before any send.
2. **The 3 MCPs need to be published to PyPI** (currently only built locally). The `mcp-publisher` workflow is the canonical path per the meok-ecosystem-navigation skill.
3. **The 3 MCPs need to be in the official MCP Registry.** Per the skill: "30 CSOAI-ORG servers now in the official MCP Registry" — need to add these 3.
4. **The keystone signing keys need to be rotated** to the production KMS for the verify URLs to work (the demo keys in the MCPs are clearly marked TODO).
5. **The meok.ai landing page needs an `/eu-code-of-practice` page** that this press release links to. Currently no such page exists.

**Estimated ship time:** 2-3 days of focused work (PyPI publish + registry + landing page + press list import + send automation), in time for the 2 August cliff.
