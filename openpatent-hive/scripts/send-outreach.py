send-outreach.py — openpatent.ai · 10-segment cold outreach engine.

Reads a CSV of {email, persona, company[, first_name]} and dispatches the
right 6-layer / Bitcoin-anchored / 5-tier sequence via the Resend API.

Features
--------
* Per-persona sequence rendering (solo_inventor, indie_studio, ip_boutique,
  gov_defense, ai_startup) — see docs/PERSONA-MATRIX.md
* Per-recipient unsubscribe URL with HMAC-signed token
* Sliding-window rate limit: 50 emails / hour, default
* --dry-run mode that prints what would be sent and writes nothing
* --segment N to send a single segment of the 10
* --cadence-mode to follow Day 0,1,3,5,7,9,12,15,18,22 or fire one batch
* --state-file for idempotent sends (won't re-send to a recipient already
  in the cadence window)

Env
---
RESEND_API_KEY must be set in zshrc (or the active shell). The script
refuses to send if it is missing.
