**Status:** 209 MCP servers ready, SOV3 healthy, infrastructure built  
**Blocker:** 5 critical items blocking ALL revenue

## 🔴 CRITICAL BLOCKERS (Do Today - Revenue Depends on These)

### 1. ACTIVATE STRIPE LIVE MODE — **BLOCKING ALL MRR**
| | Details |
|---|---|
| **Problem** | Account in test mode — cannot process real payments |
| **Impact** | £0 MRR despite 209 products ready |
| **Fix** | Complete 4-step activation |
| **Time** | 2 hours |

**Steps:**
1. Go to https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/account
2. Complete identity verification (passport/driving licence)
3. Add business bank account details
4. Submit for review (usually approved in 24-48 hours)
5. Get live API keys, replace test keys in code

**Files to update:**
- `~/clawd/unified-saas/dashboard/.env.local` (STRIPE_SECRET_KEY)
- `~/clawd/mcp-monetization-gateway/.env` (STRIPE_SECRET_KEY)
- `~/clawd/meok-labs-engine/.env` (all Stripe env vars)

### 2. FIX HARDCODED STRIPE KEY — **SECURITY BREACH RISK**

| **Fix** | Rotate key immediately |
| **Time** | 30 minutes |

**Steps:**

2. Update all env files with new key
3. Delete old key
4. Add `create-stripe-catalog.js` to `.gitignore`
5. Audit git history: `git log -p --all -S 'sk_live'`

### 3. FIX 6/6 PRICING MISALIGNMENTS — **WRONG CHARGES**

| Industry Bundle | £299/mo | £129/mo | Undercharge → Revenue leak |
| COBOL Bridge Pro | £199/mo | £2,499/mo | **Overcharge → Lawsuits** |
