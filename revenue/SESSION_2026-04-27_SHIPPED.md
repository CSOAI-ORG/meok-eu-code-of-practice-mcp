## ⏱️ The audit said this is the highest £/hr 7-day plan

Per the comprehensive audit, the floor case (P=20% on each) is £1,500-£2,500 cash + £400-£600 MRR by 30 July. Mid-case is £8K-£12K cash + £1,450 MRR. Three actions move the floor:

### Today (Mon 27 Apr) — Nick's actions
1. **List 3 domains on Sedo** — councilof.ai (£8K-£15K BIN), agisafe.ai (£8K-£15K), grabhire.ai (£5K-£10K). 60 min on sedo.com. One-shot capital potential £18K-£40K over 6-12mo.
2. **Send 5 OEM outreach emails** — copy from `OEM_OUTREACH_2026-04-27.md`. Send from `nicholas@csoai.org`. 30 min.
3. **Send first 50 NIS2-DE cold emails** — copy from `NIS2_DE_COLDMAIL_BATCH_2026-04-27.md`. 90 min. Get prospect list from LinkedIn Sales Nav trial or Hunter.io.

### Tomorrow
4. **Submit NLnet NGI Zero grant** — €30K (~£25.5K). Deadline 1 June. Application drafted.
5. **Comment on Risto Uuk EU AI Act Newsletter posts** — link `/consulting` page in comments. He has 53K subs. Expected 1 booked £950 day in 30-60 days.

### This weekend
6. **Cyber Essentials self-cert** — ~£300, 2 days. Unlocks G-Cloud 14 (still buyable through Oct 2026). Average G-Cloud SME contract is low five figures.

## 🚫 What I did NOT do (audit said defer)

- £499 Indie tier — REMOVED from pricing page (dilutive)
- £29 Starter tier consumer chatbot — left in place, separate product line
- YouTube content — deferred to Q3 2026 (need 1K subs first)
- SOV3 productized as £20-£50/mo — deferred (needs hosted infra Nick doesn't have yet)
- Maven/Teachable cohort — deferred (need 1K newsletter subs first)
- Mac App Store £99 desktop — deferred to Q4 2026
- 234-package fleet enterprise licence — deferred until first £10K reference customer

## 📊 Honest 90-day £ projection (probability-weighted)

| Channel | P(close) | £/mo or one-shot | EV |
|---|---|---|---|
| OEM white-label embedded API | 25% | £2,000/mo | £6,000 (3mo) |
| NIS2-DE cold email | 70% | £998-£2,495 one-shot | £1,200 |
| £950/day consulting (LinkedIn) | 60% | £950 one-shot | £570 |
| Bias detection £299/mo | 50% | £299/mo | £450 |
| Show HN drives kit purchases | 60% | £499-£1,996 | £750 |
| Sedo domain flips | 30% in 90d | £18K one-shot | £5,400 |
| NLnet grant | 45% | £25,500 (decision Q3) | n/a within 90d |
| Affiliate footer + Polar.sh + Gumroad | 70% | £350/mo | £735 |
| **Total weighted EV (90d cash)** | | | **~£15K** |

Floor (everything goes wrong): £1,500-£2,500 cash + £400/mo MRR.
Ceiling (everything lands): £18-£25K cash + £3-£4K/mo MRR.

The single biggest swing factor: **one** OEM outreach email landing.
