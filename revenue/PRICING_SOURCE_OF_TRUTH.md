## Product line C — Consumer companion AI (MEOK Sovereign)

Different product line — personal/family AI companion, **not** compliance MCPs.

| Tier       | Monthly | Annual    | Stripe Product           |
|------------|---------|-----------|--------------------------|
| **Explorer** | £0    | —         | (no Stripe — free tier)  |
| **BYOK**     | £5/mo  | —         | `prod_UMtUIhuvvkZT7k`    |
| **Sovereign** | £9/mo | £90/yr (save £18)  | `prod_UMtUnFkFbEVjrD`    |
| **Sovereign Pro** | £19/mo | £190/yr (save £38)  | (under Sovereign Annual) |
| **Family**   | £29/mo | £290/yr (save £58)  | `prod_UMtU2JtCzry0BC` / `prod_UMtUFh7ABnFmy8` |

These appear on `meok.ai/pricing` consumer-side. **Do not conflate with compliance Starter/Pro tiers** — different paywall, different audience.

## Bias Detection (continuous monitoring product)

| Tier                 | Price        | Stripe Product       |
|----------------------|--------------|----------------------|
| MEOK Bias Detection  | £299/mo      | `prod_UPZLiBLGjHRxF8` |
| MEOK Bias Detection Annual | £2,990/yr (saves £598) | `prod_UPdKfr9Bn30AIo` |

---

## ProofOf.ai (attestation verification)

| Tier         | Price          | Stripe Product       |
|--------------|----------------|----------------------|
| Pro          | £99/mo         | `prod_UPdAivukVrgKPm` |
| Enterprise   | £499/mo        | `prod_UPdAH4VwJIJJqK` |
| Per-cert     | (POA)          | `prod_UTyz3LQaF8tILE` |

---

## Annual bundles (legacy promo)

| Bundle                              | Price            | Stripe Product       |
|-------------------------------------|------------------|----------------------|
| MEOK Compliance Pro (Annual)        | £790/yr (saves £158)  | `prod_UPdKzL7ijL0ft7` |
| MEOK Compliance Enterprise (Annual) | £14,990/yr (saves £2,998) | `prod_UPdK6mwQW2IKOQ` |

> Enterprise Annual at £14,990/yr **= £1,249/mo** monthly-equivalent. This is what some landing pages mis-quote as "£1,499/mo" — the canonical figure is £14,990/yr or POA monthly.

## Landing /pricing simplified trio (overlays the per-MCP and pack models)

A simplified three-card structure appears on `meok.ai/pricing` for compliance:

| Card        | Price                  | Stripe price ID                                  | Backing product           |
|-------------|------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|
| **Free**       | £0 (GitHub link)    | n/a                                              | MIT-licensed MCPs         |
| **Pro**        | £79/mo (£790/yr)    | `price_1TQNeiQvIueK5XpbFB6iSl7P` (Pro monthly £79) | "MEOK Compliance Pro" `prod_UPC2arbANYFYsH` |
| **Enterprise** | £1,499/mo (£14,990/yr) | `price_1TPGoQQvIueK5XpbgZHn4D48` (Enterprise Monthly £1,499 2026 reprice) | "MEOK Compliance Enterprise" |

These are **live, working Stripe prices** — confirmed 2026-05-21. The £1,499/mo is the "2026 reprice" tier (up from earlier values). Annual saving math: 12 × £1,499 = £17,988 − £14,990 = £2,998 ✓.

## Three pricing models run in parallel — KNOWN ISSUE

There are currently three concurrent pricing models live on the site/Stripe:

1. **Per-MCP** (Starter £29/Pro £79) — used by individual MCP product pages
2. **Bundled packs** (Core £49 → Defence £499) — referenced in this SoT, no current landing surface
3. **Simplified landing trio** (Free / Pro £79 / Enterprise £1,499) — what /pricing shows

This is genuinely confusing for buyers. **Action for Nick:** decide on ONE model. Recommendation per MASTER_PLAN_2026-05-20.md is to consolidate on per-MCP Starter/Pro + one Enterprise tier — drop the Core/Gov/Sec/Ind/Defence pack carousel since no landing surface references it.

## Confirmed-removed

| Item | Status |
|------|--------|
| £499 MEOK Indie | Removed 2026-04-27 per audit. Confirmed gone. |

## Rules

1. **NEVER change prices without updating this file FIRST.**
2. **All Stripe price IDs must match this document.**
3. **If Stripe dashboard differs from this file, Stripe is wrong — fix it.**
4. **Landing pages reference this file.** If a price appears in `pricing-client.tsx`, `councilof.ai`, `meok-compliance.vercel.app`, or any storefront and is NOT listed above, it must be removed or this doc updated.
5. **Verify quarterly** that Stripe list_prices output matches this doc.
