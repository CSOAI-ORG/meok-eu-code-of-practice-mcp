# Cold Emails V3 — Industry Voice (money-first)

**Supersedes:** `COLD_EMAILS_V2.md` (kept for diff/audit — do not send V2).
**Why this rewrite:** SOV3 `detect_partnership_opportunities` scored the portfolio copy **41.8% academic / 21.5% industry** (overall 0.339). Translation: *the emails read like a research org, so industry cold outreach feels uphill.* The fix the briefing called for — **lead with the fine number, not the framework number.** "Don't pay €15M for a bias miss" beats "Article 10 conformity evidence," every time, for every industry buyer.

**Two accuracy fixes baked in (V2 was wrong — a compliance officer would catch both):**
1. **Penalty ceiling.** High-risk *obligation* gaps (Art 10/11/14/43 etc.) are penalised under **EU AI Act Art 99(4): up to €15M or 3% of global turnover** — NOT €35M/7%. The €35M/7% ceiling (Art 99(3)) applies only to **Art 5 prohibited practices**. V2 used €35M everywhere; that overstates the law and a sharp buyer knows it. V3 uses €15M/3% for high-risk gaps and reserves €35M/7% only where an Art 5 prohibited use genuinely applies (Onfido, conditionally).
2. **DORA.** Monzo/Starling/Zopa are *financial entities*, not designated *critical ICT third-party providers* — so the "1% of daily turnover" cap (a CTPP-only penalty) does NOT apply to them. V3 hooks DORA on the concrete, imminent obligation instead: the **30 April 2026 Register of Information** deadline and the **4h/24h incident clocks**.

## 1. Beamery — AI hiring (high-risk)

**TO:** abakar@beamery.com (Abakar Saidov, CEO) · linkedin.com/in/abakarsaidov
**SUBJECT:** Beamery's hiring AI — €15M exposure on the clock

Hi Abakar,

If Beamery's hiring AI isn't audited and documented before **2 December 2027**, the downside is up to **€15M or 3% of global turnover — whichever is larger.** That's the EU AI Act penalty for a high-risk system that can't show its homework, and AI used in employment decisions is high-risk by name (Annex III, Point 4).

Here's the part most teams underestimate: the technical-documentation pack has **14 mandatory fields**. Most I review cover 3 or 4. Auditors reject the rest — and "we'll fix it later" stops being an option once a customer's procurement team asks for the evidence.

[OFFER BLOCK]

15 minutes this week to walk the gaps before your enterprise buyers start asking?

## 2. Tractable — insurance claims AI (high-risk)

**TO:** venkat@tractable.ai (Venkat Sathyamurthy, CEO) · CC alex@tractable.ai
**SUBJECT:** Tractable + EU AI Act — €15M, and the claims-bias trap

Hi Venkat, Alex,

Tractable's damage-assessment AI decides claims outcomes — which puts it in Annex III (Point 5) of the EU AI Act as high-risk. Miss the **2 December 2027** documentation bar and the exposure is up to **€15M or 3% of global turnover.**

The one that bites insurers specifically: **bias testing on disparate claims outcomes.** If similar claims resolve differently across protected groups and you can't evidence why, that's the gap a market-surveillance authority opens with — and the gap a reinsurer's due diligence finds first.

[OFFER BLOCK]

It also chains into incident reporting, so if something goes sideways post-launch your Article 73 clock starts correctly instead of late.

15 mins this week?

## 3. Multiverse — apprenticeship matching AI (double high-risk)

**TO:** hello@multiverse.io (→ Euan Blair, CEO)
**SUBJECT:** Multiverse's matching AI — two high-risk hits, one deadline

Hi Euan + team,

Multiverse's AI does two regulated things at once: it **matches** learners (Annex III Point 3 — education access) and it **assesses** them (Point 4 — employment pathways). Two high-risk categories, double the documentation burden, same penalty: up to **€15M or 3% of global turnover** if it's not evidenced by **2 December 2027.**

The doubling is the trap. You need bias testing across protected characteristics on *both* the matching rail *and* the assessment rail, plus transparency to learners and human oversight on each. Teams usually document one and forget the other.

[OFFER BLOCK]

15 mins this week to map both rails?

## 4. Zopa — credit-scoring AI + DORA

**TO:** [CTO / Head of Risk via LinkedIn; fallback careers@zopa.com → ask for CTO]
**SUBJECT:** Zopa — credit-scoring AI and DORA, two clocks running

Hi [Name],

Zopa carries two live regulatory clocks, and they overlap badly:

1. **EU AI Act** — credit-scoring AI is high-risk (Annex III, Point 5b). Not evidenced by **2 December 2027** → up to **€15M or 3% of global turnover.**
2. **DORA** — in force since Jan 2025. Your **Register of Information** (Art 28) first annual submission is due **30 April 2026**, and a major ICT incident triggers a **4-hour** classification clock.

The expensive scenario is one event hitting both: an incident touching a protected class in lending fires GDPR (72h), EU AI Act (Art 73), and DORA (Art 19) in parallel. One event, three reports, three formats, three deadlines.

[OFFER BLOCK]

15 mins this week to map which controls satisfy more than one regime at once?

## 5. ClearScore — credit-score + product-matching AI (high-risk)

**TO:** hello@clearscore.com (→ route to CTO / Head of Compliance)
**SUBJECT:** ClearScore's scoring AI — €15M if the file's incomplete by Dec 2027

Hi team,

ClearScore's credit-score and product-matching AI is high-risk under the EU AI Act (Annex III, Point 5b). The number that matters: up to **€15M or 3% of global turnover** if the compliance file isn't complete by **2 December 2027.**

The under-built piece for recommendation engines is the **right to explanation** when a product is *not* shown or a score drives a decline — paired with bias testing across protected classes. That's the combination a regulator probes first, because it's where consumer harm shows up.

[OFFER BLOCK]

Worth 15 minutes before the Q-by-Q documentation crunch starts?

## 6. Onfido — biometric identity AI (highest-scrutiny)

**TO:** [Onfido — LinkedIn sales DM + general contact]
**SUBJECT:** Onfido — biometric AI sits in the EU AI Act's hottest seat

Hi [Name],

Biometric identification is the **first and most-scrutinised** high-risk category in the EU AI Act (Annex III, Point 1). Standard high-risk gaps carry up to **€15M or 3% of global turnover** by **2 December 2027** — but biometrics has a second, sharper edge: if any deployment crosses into an **Article 5 prohibited use** (e.g. certain real-time remote biometric ID, or biometric categorisation by sensitive attributes), the ceiling jumps to **€35M or 7%.**

So your compliance surface is the largest of any AI vertical: the standard high-risk pack *plus* an Article 5 prohibited-practice check *plus*, for public-authority deployments, a fundamental-rights impact assessment.

[OFFER BLOCK]

15 minutes to separate your high-risk obligations from your Article 5 exposure? They're different problems with different price tags.

## 7. Monzo — DORA (live) + NIS2 overlap

**TO:** [CTO / CISO via LinkedIn]
**SUBJECT:** Monzo — one ICT incident, two regulators, a 4-hour clock

Hi [Name],

DORA enforcement is live and the first full reporting cycle is 2026. As a credit institution, Monzo also sits under NIS2 (banking sector) — and ~60–70% of the controls overlap, which means **one ICT incident triggers both regimes in parallel.**

The tightest clock isn't a fine, it's a deadline: **NIS2 early warning within 24 hours** of awareness, **DORA major-incident classification within 4 hours.** Miss those and you're explaining a *reporting* failure on top of the original incident. And your **Register of Information** (DORA Art 28) annual submission was due **30 April 2026** — if it's not mapped to the 2024/2956 schema yet, that's the first thing to fix.

[OFFER BLOCK]

The crosswalk maps each DORA control to the NIS2 measure it already satisfies, so your team audits once, not twice. 15 mins this week?

## 8. Starling Bank — DORA Register of Information

**TO:** [CTO / Head of Engineering via LinkedIn]
**SUBJECT:** Starling — DORA Register of Information was due 30 April

Hi [Name],

The DORA Register of Information (Art 28, format fixed by Reg (EU) 2024/2956) had its **first annual submission due 30 April 2026.** Most financial entities I speak to haven't yet mapped their vendor contracts to the 2956 schema — and the supervisory attention on late or malformed registers is ramping now, not later.

The efficient move: the *same* vendor data also satisfies NIS2 supply-chain security (Art 21(2)(d)) if you hold it in one canonical register instead of two. Build it once, satisfy both.

[OFFER BLOCK]

15 minutes to walk through what your Register needs to be clean? I can show you the gap in your current vendor mapping on the call.

## 9. PARTNERSHIP — BDO UK (GRC advisory)

**TO:** [BDO UK GRC / AI-risk partner — LinkedIn "BDO AI risk" filter]
**SUBJECT:** BDO + MEOK — white-label EU AI Act assessments, you keep the margin

Hi [Name],

A partnership sized for your AI/GRC advisory practice, in three lines:

1. I've built tooling that runs the article-by-article compliance audit across EU AI Act, DORA, NIS2, CRA, CSRD, GDPR, ISO 42001, NIST AI RMF and the UK AI framework — each producing a **cryptographically signed attestation** your clients' auditors validate without touching my backend.
2. The deal: **£5,000 flat-rate assessments you white-label at your own price** (keep the margin), revenue share on every **£79/mo** subscription your clients retain, your brand on every deliverable, no exclusivity, no minimum.
3. It's the Vanta-plus-Big-4 model, rebuilt for the MCP-era compliance stack — automation underneath, your advisory relationship on top.

20 minutes this week to walk the tooling?

## 10. PARTNERSHIP — PA Consulting (AI governance practice)

**TO:** [PA Consulting AI ethics / governance lead]
**SUBJECT:** PA + MEOK — the signed artefact your clients' auditors actually accept

Hi [Name],

One pitch, three sentences:

1. I've built compliance-audit tooling spanning EU AI Act, DORA, NIS2, CRA, CSRD and the UK AI framework — every audit emits an **HMAC-SHA256 signed attestation with a public verify URL** an auditor checks in 90 seconds, no backend access.
2. Looking for a small number of consulting firms to pilot: **£5k assessments you white-label at your own pricing**, revenue share on **£79/mo** subscriptions, your brand on deliverables, no exclusivity.
3. It's live and inspectable today — packages on PyPI under MEOK_AI_Labs, verify infrastructure at meok-attestation-api.vercel.app.

20 minutes this week?
