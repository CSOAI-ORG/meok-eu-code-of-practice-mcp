## Flagship — AI compliance

| # | Domain | State | Notes / fix |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | meok.ai | ✅ | 17 routes 200 OK, FAQPage + Product schemas, /trust + /refund live, scorecard wired to attestation API |
| 2 | csoai.org | ✅ | LIVE static site, pricing tiered through `/api`, governance brand |
| 3 | proofof.ai | 🟡🚫 | **Pricing.html had placeholder Stripe URL `buy.stripe.com/proofof-pro` (404)**. I created REAL Stripe products today (£99/mo Pro, £499/mo Enterprise) and patched the source — but proofof.ai is Cloudflare-hosted, so the patch isn't live until DNS flips to Vercel OR you push the patched files to Cloudflare. Source is at `/Users/nicholas/clawd/proofof-site/` |
| 4 | cobolbridge.ai | ✅ | LIVE, 3 Stripe links visible (£199 tier). Topology says ship `cobol-bridge-mcp` for full revenue path |
| 5 | councilof.ai | ✅ | **Hydra storefront — KEEP, ranking on Google per Kimi. 10 Stripe links live** |

## *of.ai governance cluster (hosted via csoai-org)

| # | Domain | State | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| 6 | accountabilityof.ai | ✅ | LIVE → `/accountability`, £79/mo Stripe |
| 7 | agisafe.ai | 🛠 ✅ | **Fixed this session.** Was showing "councilof-ai" Vite SPA. Now redirects to `/agi-safety` with proper "AGI / Frontier-AI Safety — pre-deployment safety cases" content + £1,499/mo Stripe |
| 8 | asisecurity.ai | ✅ | LIVE → `/asi-security`, £1,499/mo Stripe |
| 9 | biasdetectionof.ai | ✅ | LIVE → `/bias-detection`, £299/mo Stripe (created this morning) |
| 10 | dataprivacyof.ai | ✅ | LIVE → `/data-privacy`, £499 + £79/mo Stripe |
| 11 | ethicalgovernanceof.ai | ✅ | LIVE → `/ethical-governance`, £1,499/mo Stripe |
| 12 | safetyof.ai | 🔴🚫 | **HTTP 415 — DNS still points at GitHub Pages (185.199.220.59), not Vercel.** I shipped `/safety.html` + redirect rule in csoai-org. Cert issuance failed because DNS needs A-record update at Namecheap to `76.76.21.21`. **You need to log into Namecheap → safetyof.ai → Advanced DNS → set A record @ to `76.76.21.21`** |
| 13 | transparencyof.ai | ✅ | LIVE → `/transparency`, £79/mo Stripe |

## Sensitive

| # | Domain | State | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| 14 | suicidestop.ai | 🛠 ✅ | **Fixed this session.** Was serving wrong "councilof-ai" Vite content. Now serves a proper crisis-resources holding page with UK Samaritans (116 123), US 988, Find A Helpline, Befrienders. `<meta robots noindex>`. Domain note states it's held in trust pending donation to a registered crisis-prevention partner |

## Vertical SaaS — built but Cloudflare-hosted, no local source

## Three things blocking maximum revenue right now

### 1. Cloudflare-hosted vertical SaaS sites (10 properties, multiple £/mo subscriptions sitting on the table)
The marketing copy promises "£7.99/month" or similar, but no Stripe link is wired. Each fix needs Cloudflare Pages access or migration to Vercel.
**Unblock:** either share Cloudflare API token (`wrangler login` from your laptop) OR pull the source down to `~/clawd/{koikeeper,fishkeeper,landlaw,grabhire,...}` and I'll patch + deploy to Vercel.

### 2. safetyof.ai DNS pointing at GitHub Pages
**Unblock (5 mins for you):** Namecheap → safetyof.ai → Advanced DNS → set A record `@` → `76.76.21.21` (Vercel IP). Save. Wait 2-5 min for cert issuance. Then I'll re-alias.

### 3. PrivateMail Chrome extension permission prompt
Still blocking me from sending the OEM + NIS2-DE outreach drafts directly.
**Unblock:** click the Claude extension icon in Chrome toolbar → approve PrivateMail.

## Highest-EV moves once unblocked

Per the two background research agents (synthesized in `RESEARCH_2026-04-27_DEEP.md` + `BLOCKERS_2026-04-27.md`):

1. **Annual-default toggle on /pricing with 17% discount** → 2-3x annual mix on every paid signup. ~30 min to ship. Highest single conversion lift in any data we have.
2. **Fix koikeeper.ai Stripe link** → site already markets £7.99/mo, just needs the link → live revenue path for niche affluent audience (koi worth £1k-50k each).
3. **Risto Uuk newsletter pitch** with `meok-omnibus-tracker` + `meok-watermark-attest` → potential reach 50K+ EU AI Act buyers in a single mention.
4. **Show HN of `meok-omnibus-tracker`** Tuesday 0800 PT → indie SaaS reports 11K visits / 1,800 signups / 16% conversion from one good Show HN.
5. **30 UK boutique GRC consultancy white-label pitches** at 30% rev share → 1 reseller in 90 days closes 3-10 deals year one.
