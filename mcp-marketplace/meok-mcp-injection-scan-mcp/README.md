**Scan any MCP server for the prompt-injection / tool-poisoning / SSRF class disclosed in the April 2026 CVE wave.**

```
pip install meok-mcp-injection-scan-mcp
```

## Why This Exists

The EU AI Act's high-risk system provisions come into full force in **November 2026**. Companies deploying AI in healthcare, finance, education, law enforcement, and critical infrastructure face fines of up to **€35 million or 7% of global turnover**.

Most compliance teams spend **£360,000/year** on manual governance. This MCP server automates the entire process in minutes.

**Perfect for:**
- Compliance officers preparing for audits
- AI governance teams tracking regulatory deadlines  
- Consultants delivering AI readiness assessments
- Developers building compliant AI systems

## Why this exists

April 2026 was a bad month for MCP. Anthropic published a "by-design" MCP RCE class affecting ~7,000 public servers (~150M downloads). `mcp-server-git` shipped a CVE chain. DockerDash got popped by an injection chain. Tool-description prompt injection ("tool poisoning") was demonstrated against every major MCP host.

If you run an MCP server in production, or you're auditing one before adoption, you need a fast scan that flags the patterns the April 2026 disclosures target. This MCP is that scan.

## What it checks

**30+ canonical rules** across 5 severity tiers:

- **CRITICAL** — direct RCE, system-prompt override, credential exfil patterns, shell metachars in defaults, file:// / internal-network URLs (the DockerDash 169.254.169.254 metadata-pivot vector).
- **HIGH** — encoded payloads, imperative directives at the agent, supply-chain prompts, env-var references, tool shadowing.
- **MEDIUM** — urgency / authority language, `additionalProperties=true`, unbounded strings, tool-name impersonation.
- **LOW** — over-long descriptions, zero-width / bidi-override chars (the U+202E PoC vector).

Coverage maps to: OWASP LLM Top 10, GenAI Red Team v1, the April 2026 Anthropic MCP RCE disclosure, and the `mcp-server-git` CVE chain.

## Tools exposed

| Tool | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `scan_mcp_url(url)` | Fetch a remote MCP server's tool listing and scan it |
| `audit_tool_descriptions(tools_json)` | Scan a pasted JSON tool list (auth-walled servers) |
| `signed_safety_report(subject, findings_json, score, note)` | Issue a procurement-grade signed cert (Pro tier) |
| `list_rules()` | Inspect the full rule catalogue before subscribing |
| `pricing()` | Subscribe links + tier comparison |

## Pricing

| Tier | Price | What you get |
|---|---|---|
| Free | £0 | 5 scans / day, no signed reports |
| Starter | [£29/mo](https://buy.stripe.com/00wfZjcgAeUW4c5cyQ8k90K) | Unlimited scans + signed reports |
| Pro | [£79/mo](https://buy.stripe.com/00wfZjcgAeUW4c5cyQ8k90K) | + scheduled rescans + 48h support |
| Enterprise | [£1,499/mo](https://buy.stripe.com/00wfZjcgAeUW4c5cyQ8k90K) | + custom rule packs + 4h SLA |

Every signed cert lives at `https://meok-attestation-api.vercel.app/verify/<cert_id>` — auditors and procurement teams confirm without an account.

## What you do NOT get

This is a static-pattern scanner. It does not run dynamic taint analysis, fuzz the server with adversarial inputs, or replace a human red-team. It is the first 80% of the audit, in 5 seconds, for free.
